 A simple React app that pulls a certain number of random users and shows them in separete card and also in table veiw. You can add new contacts and delete ones you want manually.
 # purpose
 I am new to all these consepts. With this basic project i learn a lot about react's workflow, lifecycles, components, condintional redering and fetching urls. I think this repository will show a lot of things you should do and should not do as a newby in react or coding.
